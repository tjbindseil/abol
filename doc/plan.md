## info

### how to
* always
    * spot for message

## to prioritize

## now, in priority order:
1. show permisions status
    * show when a user has enabled always allow location
    * show when a user has enabled the lockscreen widget
2. better icon
3. rename project (rbol)
4. clear note button

## V2
* a way to rearm alarm when it goes off, option to rearm from current location or original location
* advanced mode (a way to remind someone to do something when they get somewhere)
* show map with where thing was alarmed, allow users to alarm at a given map point and radius
* show note on lock screen widget
* testing
    * do it with a script, including reseting
        * thiturned out to be quite difficult, see testing.md

## bugs
0. when user arms app, kills app, opens app (before disarming or firing), the "armed at" is not present

## completed
* better title

    - see tasks/alarm_instead_of_notification.md
